# Official.fm API v2

This is the reference guide of all the resources available on Official.fm API v2.

There are 2 types of API:

  * [Official.fm API](https://github.com/officialfm/api/blob/master/sections/api.md) (Catalog search...etc)
  * [Player API](https://github.com/officialfm/api/blob/master/sections/player_api.md) (Standard or highly customizable players)
  
## oEmbed

Official.fm supports oEmbed ([documentation](https://github.com/officialfm/api/blob/master/sections/oembed.md)).

[oEmbed](http://oembed.com) is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a URL on third party sites. It allows a website to display embedded content (such as photos or videos) when a user posts a link to that resource, without having to parse the resource directly.

## Issues or Questions?

Questions about the API can be asked by [opening an issue](https://github.com/officialfm/api/issues/new) for this project, or contacting us privately [api@official.fm](mailto:api@official.fm).
